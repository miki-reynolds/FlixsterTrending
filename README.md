## Notes

Google Secrets took me a while.
Serialization and Deserialization objects (movie and show class/objects) when transmitting data between activities using intent.
Fragment implementation so it could save me some time later down the road when we explore the topic I think week 6.
Asthetics/layouts took probably 30 - 40% of the time, adjusting pic size and whatnots, learning a lot about sizing and layout as a result.
Some of the lab dependencies and usage don't apply well with my project since my android studio/gradle versions (uncertain) got updated a while back.
I figured exploration was worthwhile and exciting, which took me a lot of hours but very rewarding.
